		    <p>Having great content isn’t enough.</p>
			<p>You have to make sure that your great content is seen. And you have to make sure it is seen while it can help influence the buying process.</p>
			<p>There two reasons why this is a big challenge.</p>
			<p>The first is that the complexity of B-to-B sales means that there are social interactions within the company that we can’t see influencing the process. Combine that with long sales cycles and numerous stakeholders and you have a beast of a challenge trying to put the right content in front of the right set of eyeballs.</p>
			<p>Given the complexity of selling to other businesses it shouldn’t come as much of surprise that the second big challenge is figuring out how to deliver the right content. There are thousands of tools that a marketer can apply to the challenge of delivering content.</p>
			<p>For each specific problem that you have, there are usually dozens of tools that you can apply as you have defined the problem and a handful of innovative ways that you could redefine the problem and come up with a new set of tools.</p>
			<p>All of this is to say that delivering the right content to the right people at the right time is one of the biggest challenges for the modern B-to-B marketer.</p>
			<h2>Understanding the Context of an Interaction Within Your Marketing System</h2>
			<p>Caret Juice uses Jobs-to-be-Done interviews to understand what causes an interaction so that we can design more satisfying buyer experiences but we also use our interviews to understand the context of an interaction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What thoughts and conversations come before?</li>
				<li>Now that you’ve completed your task, what comes next?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can take the guesswork out of delivering the right content to the right audience at the right time by interviewing for context and building a better map of how interactions typically relate to each other.</p>
			<p>Jobs-to-be-Done interviews helps you understand what causes your audience to interact but our interviews don’t just draw on JTBD. Interviewing for context helps you understand how to fit your content together to build a persuasive system of interactions that meet the evolving needs of people in your funnel.</p>
			<p>With a better understanding of causes, context, and needs, delivering the right content becomes so much easier.</p>
