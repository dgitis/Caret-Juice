      <p>Hi, I'm Damon.</p><p>I got started in marketing about ten years ago. 
      The company hired the best consultants they could find to train me to run 
      search engine optimization because of my I had the right mix of technical and 
      creative skills to succeed.</p><p>I'm a big advocate for tracking the return on investment
      of your marketing and a long-time member of the Digital Analytics Association.</p><p>
      I most recently worked for an ERP vendor where I managed marketing technology and 
      got a first-hand look at how a variety of companies managed the introduction of
      new business technologies and how consultants helped smooth the transition.</p>
